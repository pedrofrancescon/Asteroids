 # Black Holes - The gravitational force
 
 On the previous page we played with *forces*, seeing how changing one object's mass can cause it to move fast or slowly.
 
 In this page we are going to explore a specific kind of *force*, following one more of the many discoveries of the great Isaac Newton, the **gravitational force**. This force is the responsible for pulling you back to the ground when you jump or for making an apple üçé fall from a tree, for example.
 
 Newton actually found out that this force is basically everywhere and makes all objects in the universe to attract one another with a really really weak force, unless the mass of one of the objects is really high (such as the Earth‚Äôs üåé).
 
 One great example of something with extremely high mass that can be found in outer space is the **black hole**. Most of them are formed when a star ‚≠êÔ∏è is dying and they exert such a strong **gravitational force** that even light can‚Äôt escape from it! They are still in some ways a mystery, and some really clever and amazing people, such as the eternal Stephen Hawking, spent a great part of their lives studying it.
 
 In this page you also play with masses, although now you are going to be in control of a much higher mass, the mass of the **black hole** itself. One of the asteroids will have a force applied to it, and the other one will be still and will only move by the **gravitational force**.
 
 So, what are you waiting for? Make them blow!
