# Asteroids - WWDC18 Scholarship Submission

![](https://github.com/pedrofrancescon/Images/blob/master/Asteroids_cover.png)

This is a Swift Playgrounds made for the 2018 WWDC Scholarship. It's intended to teach basic concepts of classical physics alongside with programming. 

> If you are going to run it on the iPad, I suggest using the "Asteroids.playgroundbook" file for a better experience. üòâ

I also made a video (in Portuguese) explaining the whole creation process of this game, from all the assets to the code. I hope you like it! ‚ù§Ô∏è
